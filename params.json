{"name":"Rmate","tagline":"Remote TextMate 2 implemented as shell script","body":"# rmate\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nTextMate 2 adds a nice feature, where it is possible to edit files on a remote server\r\nusing a helper script. The original helper script provided with TM2 is implemented in\r\nruby. Here is my attempt to replace this ruby script with a shell script, because in \r\nsome cases a ruby installation might just be to much overhead for just editing remote\r\nfiles.\r\n\r\nThe shell script needs to be copied to the server, you want to remote edit files, on.\r\nAfter that, open your TM2 preferences and enable \"Allow rmate connections\" setting in\r\nthe \"Terminal\" settings and adjust the setting \"Access for\" according to your needs:\r\n\r\n### Local clients\r\n\r\nIt's a good idea to allow access only for local clients. In this case you need to open\r\na SSH connection to the system you want to edit a file on and specify a remote tunnel in\r\naddition:\r\n\r\n\tssh -R 52698:localhost:52698 user@example.com\r\n\r\nIf you are logged in on the remote system, you can now just execute\r\n\r\n\trmate test.txt\r\n\t\r\n\r\n### Remote clients\r\n\r\nOn some machines, where port forwarding is not possible, for example due to a missing ssh\r\ndaemon, you can allow access for \"remote clients\". Just ssh or telnet to the remote machine\r\nand execute:\r\n\r\n    rmate -H textmate-host test.txt\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\nExample session: Editing html file located on an SGI o2: <https://github.com/aurora/rmate/wiki/Screens>\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nA bash with compiled support for \"/dev/tcp\" is required. This is not the case on some \r\nolder linux distributions, like Ubuntu 9.x.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n    $ ./rmate [-H host-name] [-p port-number] [-w] [-l line-number] [-m display-name] [-t file-type] [-f] [-v] file-path\r\n\r\n### Required parameters\r\n\r\n_rmate_ takes a file as last argument. This argument is always required.\r\n\r\n### Optional parameters\r\n\r\n    -H  connect to host (default: localhost)\r\n    -p  port number to use for connection (default: 52698)\r\n    -w  wait for file to be closed by TextMate\r\n    -l  place caret on line number after loading file\r\n    -m  the display name shown in TextMate\r\n    -t  treat file as having specified type\r\n    -f  open even if file is not writable\r\n    -v  verbose logging messages\r\n    -h  display this usage information\r\n\r\n### Default parameter configuration\r\n\r\nSome default parameters (_host_ and _port_) can be configured by defining them \r\nas the environment variables `RMATE_HOST` and `RMATE_PORT` or by putting them \r\nin a configuration file. The configuration files loaded are `/etc/rmate.rc` \r\nand `~/.rmate.rc`, e.g.:\r\n\r\n    host: auto  # prefer host from SSH_CONNECTION over localhost\r\n    port: 52698\r\n\r\nThe precedence for setting the configuration is (higher precedence counts):\r\n\r\n1. default (localhost, 52698)\r\n2. /etc/rmate.rc\r\n3. ~/.rmate.rc\r\n4. environment variables (RMATE\\_HOST, RMATE\\_PORT)\r\n\r\n## Disclaimer\r\n\r\nUse with caution.
